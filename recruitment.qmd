We are currently looking for **highly motivated Master's and Ph.D. students** to join our research group starting in **2027**.

### Research Directions

Our group focuses on data-driven studies of scientific systems, with three core research directions:

1. **Academic career trajectories of early-career researchers**  
   We investigate the evolution of academic careers of young scholars and the underlying mechanisms shaping their long-term development and success, with a particular focus on both **individual-level dynamics** and **team-based processes**, such as mentorship, collaboration structures, and group organization.

2. **Quantifying the impact of artificial intelligence on disciplinary communication and knowledge diffusion**  
   We study how AI technologies influence **interdisciplinary communication**, **knowledge dissemination**, and the structure of scientific exchange across disciplines.

3. **Data-driven modeling of scientific discovery and innovation processes**  
   We develop computational and statistical models to understand and characterize patterns of scientific discovery, innovation, and knowledge production using large-scale scholarly data.

Students with interests in **Science of Science**, **AI and science**, **network science**, or **data-driven modeling of scientific systems** are especially encouraged to apply.

### Prospective Master's and Ph.D. Students (2027 Intake)

Applicants with a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, data science**, or related fields will be well suited for the group. Prior experience with **Python, SQL, machine learning, or large-scale data analysis** is a plus, but not strictly required.

### Pre-Master and Pre-Doctoral Opportunities

Students planning to apply for the **2027 Master's or Ph.D. programs** are welcome to **contact me in advance** to explore opportunities to join the group as **pre-master's or pre-doctoral researchers**.

During the pre-master / pre-doctoral period, students will:
- Participate in ongoing research projects
- Receive close research mentorship and training
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world research data
- Be supported in preparing for graduate applications

**Appropriate research stipends** will be provided based on individual engagement and project involvement.

### How to Apply

If you are interested, please send an email to  
**yanmeng0608@outlook.com**  
with:
- A brief CV
- Academic transcripts (if available)
- A short description of your research interests and background

Early contact is strongly encouraged.
