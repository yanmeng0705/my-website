We are currently looking for **highly motivated Master's and Ph.D. students** to join our research group starting in **2027**.

### Research Directions

Our group conducts interdisciplinary research at the intersection of **Science of Science**, **Complex Networks**, and **Academic Career Development**. We use large-scale data and computational methods to study how mentorship, collaboration structures, and team dynamics shape scientific careers over the life course.

In addition, we are increasingly interested in **artificial intelligence–driven approaches** to understanding **research network dynamics and knowledge evolution**, including:
- The role of AI in shaping cross-disciplinary knowledge creation
- Network dynamics of scientific collaboration and authorship
- The evolution of research topics and ideas across disciplines
- Data-driven modeling of scientific discovery and innovation processes

Students with interests in **AI for science**, **network science**, **computational social science**, or **data-driven studies of knowledge systems** are especially encouraged to apply.

### Prospective Master's and Ph.D. Students (2027 Intake)

Applicants with a strong background in **mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, data science**, or related fields will be well suited for the group. Prior experience with **Python, SQL, machine learning, or large-scale data analysis** is a plus, but not strictly required.

### Pre-Master and Pre-Doctoral Opportunities

Students planning to apply for the **2027 Master's or Ph.D. programs** are welcome to **contact me in advance** to explore opportunities to join the group as **pre-master's or pre-doctoral researchers**.

During the pre-master / pre-doctoral period, students will:
- Participate in ongoing research projects
- Receive close research mentorship and training
- Gain hands-on experience with real-world research data
- Be supported in preparing for graduate applications

**Appropriate research stipends** will be provided based on individual engagement and project involvement.

### How to Apply

If you are interested, please send an email to  
**yanmeng0608@outlook.com**  
with:
- A brief CV
- Academic transcripts (if available)
- A short description of your research interests and background

Early contact is strongly encouraged.
