    "text": "We are currently looking for highly motivated Master’s and Ph.D. students to join our research group starting in 2027.\n\nResearch Directions\nOur group focuses on data-driven studies of scientific systems, with three core research directions:\n\nAcademic career trajectories of early-career researchers\nWe investigate the evolution of academic careers of young scholars and the underlying mechanisms shaping their long-term development and success, with a particular focus on both individual-level dynamics and team-based processes, such as mentorship, collaboration structures, and group organization.\nQuantifying the impact of artificial intelligence on disciplinary communication and knowledge diffusion\nWe study how AI technologies influence interdisciplinary communication, knowledge dissemination, and the structure of scientific exchange across disciplines.\nData-driven modeling of scientific discovery and innovation processes\nWe develop computational and statistical models to understand and characterize patterns of scientific discovery, innovation, and knowledge production using large-scale scholarly data.\n\nStudents with interests in Science of Science, AI and science, network science, or data-driven modeling of scientific systems are especially encouraged to apply.\n\n\nProspective Master’s and Ph.D. Students (2027 Intake)\nApplicants with a strong background in mathematics, statistics, computer science, physics, data science, or related fields will be well suited for the group. Prior experience with Python, SQL, machine learning, or large-scale data analysis is a plus, but not strictly required.\n\n\nPre-Master and Pre-Doctoral Opportunities\nStudents planning to apply for the 2027 Master’s or Ph.D. programs are welcome to contact me in advance to explore opportunities to join the group as pre-master’s or pre-doctoral researchers.\nDuring the pre-master / pre-doctoral period, students will: - Participate in ongoing research projects - Receive close research mentorship and training - Gain hands-on experience with real-world research data - Be supported in preparing for graduate applications\nAppropriate research stipends will be provided based on individual engagement and project involvement.\n\n\nHow to Apply\nIf you are interested, please send an email to\nyanmeng0608@outlook.com\nwith: - A brief CV - Academic transcripts (if available) - A short description of your research interests and background\nEarly contact is strongly encouraged.\n\nWe aim to build an inclusive, collaborative, and intellectually open research environment, and we welcome students who are curious, self-motivated, and eager to explore data-driven research questions at the frontier of science."
