## About Me

I am a researcher at **Beijing Normal University**, specializing in **Science of Science**, **Complex Networks**, and **Scientometrics**. My research explores the fundamental patterns of scientific career development, mentorship dynamics, and the evolution of scientific knowledge.

My recent work, published in **Nature Human Behaviour**, investigates how the size of academic groups influences the survival and success of mentees. This study has been featured by [**Nature News**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00644-9): *"How to pick a mentor: what the data say"*.

## Research Interests

* **Science of Science**: Career pathways, mentorship impact, and academic mobility.
* **Complex Systems**: Cascading dynamics and resilience in scientific networks.
* **Scientometrics**: Large-scale data analysis using MAG, OpenAlex, and APS.

## News

* **[2025.03]** Our research on academic mentorship is published in ***Nature Human Behaviour*** and highlighted by ***Nature***.
* **[2024.08]** New preprint available: "Exaptation: Academic mentees' career pathway to be independent and impactful."
* **[2021.07]** Solving the cold-start problem in scientific credit allocation published in *Journal of Informetrics*.
