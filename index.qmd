## Biography

I am an independent **Principal Investigator (PI)** at the Data Management Innovation Research Center, **Nanjing University**. My research expertise lies in **Science of Science**, **Complex Networks**, and **Scientometrics**. I am particularly interested in the career development paths of young scholars and the mechanisms of academic mentorship.

My recent research, published in ***Nature Human Behaviour***, explores how academic group size influences mentee success. This work has been highlighted by [***Nature News***](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00644-9).

Currently, I am leading a research project supported by the **National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) Youth Fund**.
