## About Me

I am a researcher at **Beijing Normal University**, specializing in **Science of Science**, **Complex Networks**, and **Scientometrics**. My research explores the fundamental patterns of scientific career development, mentorship dynamics, and the evolution of scientific knowledge.

My recent work, published in **Nature Human Behaviour**, investigates how the size of academic groups influences the survival and success of mentees, a study that has been featured by [**Nature News**](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00644-9).

## Research Interests

* **Science of Science**: Career pathways and mentorship.
* **Complex Systems**: Dynamics and cascading failures in networks.
* **Scientometrics**: Large-scale data analysis of scientific publications.

## News

* **[2025.03]** Our research on academic mentorship is published in ***Nature Human Behaviour*** and featured in ***Nature***.
* **[2024.08]** New preprint available: "Exaptation: Academic mentees' career pathway to be independent and impactful."
